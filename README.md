**HexBot** is a project controlling a 6 legged robot with mono.

It uses a Lynxmotion SSC-32U USB Servo controller board (http://www.lynxmotion.com/p-1032-ssc-32u-usb-servo-controller.aspx) for controlling the 18 servo motors.
The code runs on a rasperry pi that can be controlled via bluetooth. A smartphone can be used to move the robot around.
